# Design Brainstorming for Sony Music Standard Rate Card Calculator

<response>
<text>
**Design Movement:** Neo-Brutalist Pop
**Core Principles:**
*   **Bold & Professional:** High contrast, thick borders, and vibrant colors to convey Sony Music's professional edge.
*   **Functional Clarity:** Large, chunky inputs and buttons that make the calculator feel tactile and easy to use.
*   **Data-First:** The price and breakdown are the heroes, displayed in large, monospaced typography.
*   **Transparency:** Clear visual hierarchy showing how the numbers add up.

**Color Philosophy:**
*   **Sony Music Green (#58CC02)** as the primary action color.
*   **Sony Red (#C80000)** for accents and alerts.
*   **Stark White (#FFFFFF)** and **Jet Black (#000000)** for high contrast.
*   **Light Gray (#F5F5F5)** for background panels.
*   *Intent:* To create a tool that feels professional and authoritative—fun but serious about business.

**Layout Paradigm:**
*   **Split Screen:** Left side for inputs (Artist Tier, Duration, etc.), Right side for real-time results (Price, Breakdown).
*   **Card-Based:** Each section (Campaign Type, Artist Selection) is a distinct "card" with a hard drop shadow.
*   **Sticky Summary:** The final price stays visible as you scroll or adjust settings.

**Signature Elements:**
*   **Hard Shadows:** Buttons and cards have solid black drop shadows (no blur).
*   **Musical Elements:** Subtle vector illustrations of musical notes or abstract shapes.
*   **Toggle Switches:** Chunky, pill-shaped toggles for "Billboard Hot 100" or "Campaign Type".

**Interaction Philosophy:**
*   **Instant Feedback:** Price updates immediately as inputs change.
*   **Satisfying Clicks:** Buttons have a distinct "pressed" state (transform: translate).
*   **Hover Effects:** Elements lift up or glow slightly on hover.

**Animation:**
*   **Number Rolling:** The final price "rolls" up or down when it changes (like a slot machine or gas pump).
*   **Bounce:** Subtle bounce on modal opens or card appearances.

**Typography System:**
*   **Headings:** **"Space Grotesk"** or similar bold, geometric sans-serif.
*   **Body:** **"Inter"** or **"DM Sans"** for high readability.
*   **Numbers:** **"JetBrains Mono"** or **"Roboto Mono"** to emphasize the data/calculation aspect.

**Design Movement:** Corporate Minimalist (Swiss Style)
**Core Principles:**
*   **Precision & Trust:** Clean lines, ample whitespace, and a strict grid system.
*   **Hierarchy:** Typography size and weight dictate the flow of information.
*   **Neutrality:** A canvas that lets the artist names and tiers stand out without visual clutter.
*   **Professionalism:** Geared towards executive decision-making.

**Color Philosophy:**
*   **Sony Black (#000000)** and **White (#FFFFFF)** as the base.
*   **Electric Blue (#0055FF)** for interactions and highlights (representing the "digital" aspect).
*   **Subtle Greys** for dividers and secondary text.
*   *Intent:* To convey authority, reliability, and the premium nature of the Sony Music roster.

**Layout Paradigm:**
*   **Single Column Flow:** A linear, step-by-step journey (Step 1: Choose Artist, Step 2: Define Campaign, etc.).
*   **Asymmetric Grid:** Text on the left, interactive elements aligned to the right.
*   **Floating Action Bar:** A bottom bar on mobile (or sticky side panel on desktop) showing the running total.

**Signature Elements:**
*   **Thin Lines:** 1px dividers separating sections.
*   **Typography as Image:** Large, bold headings used as graphic elements.
*   **Micro-Interactions:** Subtle color shifts on hover, no heavy movements.

**Interaction Philosophy:**
*   **Smooth Transitions:** Fade-ins and sliding reveals for new sections.
*   **Focus States:** Input fields highlight with a clean blue border when active.

**Animation:**
*   **Fade & Slide:** Content gently fades in and slides up as you scroll.
*   **Progress Bar:** A subtle line at the top indicating how far through the configuration you are.

**Typography System:**
*   **Headings:** **"Helvetica Now"** or **"Arial"** (classic, Swiss).
*   **Body:** **"Helvetica Now"** or **"Inter"**.
*   **Data:** **"Tabular Nums"** enabled for price alignment.

**Design Movement:** Glassmorphism / Modern SaaS
**Core Principles:**
*   **Depth & Layering:** Using translucency and blur to create a sense of hierarchy and modernity.
*   **Softness:** Rounded corners, gradients, and soft shadows.
*   **Vibrancy:** Using background gradients to inject energy without overwhelming the content.
*   **Tech-Forward:** Feels like a modern app or dashboard.

**Color Philosophy:**
*   **Gradient Backgrounds:** Soft blends of Sony Music Green and a cool Purple/Blue.
*   **Glass White:** Semi-transparent white layers for content containers.
*   **Dark Text:** For readability on light backgrounds.
*   *Intent:* To feel cutting-edge, digital-native, and premium.

**Layout Paradigm:**
*   **Dashboard View:** A central "control panel" with widgets for different settings.
*   **Sidebar Navigation:** Quick jumps to different sections (if content is long).
*   **Overlay Modals:** For detailed breakdowns or definitions.

**Signature Elements:**
*   **Frosted Glass:** Backdrop-filter: blur() on cards.
*   **Soft Gradients:** Mesh gradients in the background.
*   **Rounded Icons:** Friendly, rounded iconography.

**Interaction Philosophy:**
*   **Fluidity:** Elements morph and resize smoothly.
*   **Parallax:** Subtle background movement on mouse move.

**Animation:**
*   **Blur In:** Elements blur into focus.
*   **Scale:** Cards scale up slightly on hover.

**Typography System:**
*   **Headings:** **"Poppins"** or **"Outfit"** (geometric but friendly).
*   **Body:** **"Inter"**.
